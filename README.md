# DetroitCrashes
This repository is a project in which I use machine learning to analyze car crash data in a public database from Detroit. I use the features in the database to predict which crashes are fatal. The code for the entire project is in the .ipynb Jupyter notebook and should be runnable using only the files provided in the repository and some standard Python libraries. Comments on my approach to the project are provided in markdown cells throughout the notebook. The following libraries are required:

sklearn<br>
pandas<br>
numpy<br>
matplotlib<br>
mpl_toolkits<br>
time<br>
math<br>
warnings<br>
functools<br>
joblib<br>
<br>
I used Python version 3.7<br>
<br>
For detailed requirements see requirements.txt<br>
I welcome any comments people are generous enough to provide.
